# UNet

The UNet is convolutional network architecture for fast and precise segmentation of images. Up to now it has outperformed the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. It has won the Grand Challenge for Computer-Automated Detection of Caries in Bitewing Radiography at ISBI 2015, and it has won the Cell Tracking Challenge at ISBI 2015 on the two most challenging transmitted light microscopy categories (Phase contrast and DIC microscopy) by a large margin

This implementation was focused on understanding the idea and intuition behind UNet architecture, and it's model implementation in Tensorflow-Keras.
